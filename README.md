## Overview 📈  

This repository contains my submission for the *Computer Infrastructure assessment*. The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook that works through a series of practical problems designed to demonstrate understanding of core computer infrastructure concepts using Python.  

This project automates the collection and visualisation of recent stock market data for the five FAANG companies: Meta (Facebook), Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. Using the yfinance Python package, the project downloads hourly stock price data for the previous five days and saves it locally in a structured format.

The repository contains functions to retrieve and store the data, generate a combined plot of closing prices for all five stocks, and run the full workflow from a single executable Python script. In addition, the project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs the script every Saturday morning. 

All functionality is documented and demonstrated in a Jupyter Notebook, which explains the implementation of each step, including data collection, plotting, scripting, and automation.
